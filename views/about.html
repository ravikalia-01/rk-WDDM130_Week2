    <h2>History and Development of Express.js</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Express.js</strong> is a fast, minimal, and flexible web framework for Node.js, designed for building web applications and APIs. It was created by <strong>TJ Holowaychuk</strong> and released in <strong>2010</strong>. Express became the de facto standard server framework for Node.js due to its simplicity, extensibility, and large community support.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over the years, Express has become the foundational component in many stacks such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEAN_(solution_stack)" target="_blank">MEAN</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MERN" target="_blank">MERN</a> stacks, where it serves as the back-end layer to power web and mobile apps.
    </p>

    <p>
      Express is maintained by the <a href="https://openjsf.org" target="_blank">OpenJS Foundation</a> and is open-source on <a href="https://github.com/expressjs/express" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Its development continues with community contributions, focusing on performance, extensibility, and security.
